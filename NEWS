SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Package dependence

    When 'ratio=TRUE', the denominator is now equal to the number of
    ordered pairs of data points considered. This does not affect the

    o bw.relrisk.lpp
    When 'method="likelihood"', the cross-validation criterion

BUG FIXES

    o density.lpp
    If 'weights' were given, the results were completely incorrect

    Did not display the main title in some cases.
    Fixed.
    
    o "[.lpp", "[.linnet"

OVERVIEW

    o Package initialised at version 1.65-0

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o spatstat.linnet
    The package 'spatstat.linnet' has been created from a subset
    of the code in the original 'spatstat' package version 1.65-0.
    It contains the functionality for statistical analysis of
    spatial data on a linear network.
    For an overview, see help("spatstat.linnet-package")

    o Execution
    The 'spatstat.linnet' package is slightly faster than the corresponding
    code in the 'spatstat' package, because the procedure for calling
    internal C functions has been streamlined.
