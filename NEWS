OVERVIEW

    o We thank Greg McSwiggan, Fernando Milesi, Mehdi Moradi, Gopalan Nair
    and James Pope for contributions.
    
    o spatstat.linnet now depends on the new packages 'spatstat.explore'

    o Kernel smoothing on a linear network.
    
    o K function and pair correlation function based on Euclidean distance.

    o Inhomogeneous J function on a network.

    o Terminal vertices of a network.
    
    o Points along a network can be drawn as cross-ticks.

    o Marks attached to vertices and segments of a network.
    
    o Important change to K function and pair correlation function
    when 'ratio=TRUE'.

    o U-shaped curves in 'rhohat'.

    o Faster computation of the length of the disc in the shortest path metric.
    
    o Minor improvements and bug fixes.

    o Improvements to internal code.

    o Minor internal changes to package information.

NEW FUNCTIONS

    o lineardisclength
    Compute the length of the disc in the shortest-path metric.
    
    o marks.linnet, marks<-.linnet
    Marks attached to the vertices and segments of a linear network.
    
    o Smooth.lpp
    Kernel smoothing (Nadaraya-Watson) on a linear network.

    o distmap.lpp
    Distance map for a point pattern on a network.
    
    o linearKEuclid, linearpcfEuclid, linearKEuclidInhom, linearpcfEuclidInhom
    K function and pair correlation function based on Euclidean distances.

    Inhomogeneous J function on a linear network.

    o terminalvertices
    Extract the terminal vertices of a linear network.

    o bw.relrisk.lpp
    This function replaces 'bw.relrisklpp'
    and is a method for the generic 'bw.relrisk'.

    o rThomaslpp
    Simulate Thomas cluster process on a network.
    
SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Package dependence
    'spatstat.linnet' now depends on the new packages 'spatstat.explore'
    and 'spatstat.model' rather than the old 'spatstat.core'.
    
    o plot.lpp
    If 'shape="crossticks"', the points will be drawn as
    short line segments perpendicular to the network.

    o linearK, linearpcf, linearKdot, linearKcross, linearpcfcross, linearpcfdot
    When 'ratio=TRUE', the denominator is now equal to the number of
    ordered pairs of data points considered. This does not affect the
    summary function, but it changes the calculation of pooled estimates.
    
    o densityQuick.lpp
    If 'sigma' is a function for selecting a bandwidth,
    additional arguments '...' of densityQuick.lpp will be passed to 'sigma',
    provided they match the name of a formal argument of 'sigma'.

    o bw.relrisklpp
    This function is now deprecated, and is replaced by 'bw.relrisk.lpp',
    a method for the generic 'bw.relrisk'.

    o bw.relrisk.lpp
    When 'method="likelihood"', the cross-validation criterion
    is now defined as the *negative* likelihood. This is consistent with
    'bw.relrisk.ppp', and ensures that the optimum bandwidth is always
    found by minimising the cross-validation criterion.

    o integral.linim, integral.linfun
    New argument 'weight' specifies a weight function for the integration.
    
    o rhohat.lpp, rhohat.lppm

    for estimating a unimodal function (U-shaped curve).

    o rhohat.lpp, rhohat.lppm
    If the covariate is a 'distfun' on a network, the unit of length
    will be saved, and will be displayed on the plot.

    o rhohat.lpp, rhohat.lppm
    New arguments 'jitter', 'jitterfactor', 'interpolate' allow greater
    control over the calculation.

    o plot.linnet
    Optionally displays the marks of the segments or marks of the vertices.
    Changed argument list.
    
    o print.linnet, summary.linnet
    These functions print information about marks of the segments or vertices.

    o predict.lppm
    Can now compute standard errors.

    o predict.lppm
    New formal arguments 'covariates' and 'se'.

    o rhohat.lpp, rhohat.lppm
    New argument 'do.CI' specifies whether to calculate confidence bands.
    
BUG FIXES

    o density.lpp
    If 'weights' were given, the results were completely incorrect
    when leaveoneout=TRUE (the default) and at="points".

    o spatstat.model::effectfun
    Results were sometimes incorrect for 'lppm' objects.
    [Spotted by Fernando A. Milesi]
    Fixed.
    
    o predict.lppm
    Ignored argument 'covariates'.
    Fixed.
    
    o rhohat.lpp, rhohat.lppm
    The argument 'subset' was not handled correctly in the internal data.
    The estimated function 'rho' was correct
    but the results of 'predict.rhohat' may have been incorrect
    and were computed only on the 'subset'.
    Fixed.

    o plot.lpp
    Did not display the main title in some cases.
    Fixed.
    
    o "[.lpp", "[.linnet"
    Ignored marks attached to the network segments.
    Fixed.

    o "[.lpp", "[.linnet"
    Crashed if the network vertices had marks, when 'snip=TRUE'.
    Fixed.

    o densityQuick.lpp
    Crashed sometimes with a message about unequal lengths of vectors.
    Fixed.

    o rjitterlpp
    This function still exists, but is now deprecated in favour of 'rjitter.lpp'.

BUG FIXES

    o rjitterlpp
    The argument 'radius' was interpreted as a fraction of segment length
    rather than an absolute distance.
    Fixed.

    o response.lppm
    Method for 'response' for fitted point process models on a network.

BUG FIXES

    o Math.linim
    If 'Z' was a pixel image on a network (class 'linim')
    and 'v' was a single number, then 'Z/v' was a pixel image (class 'im')
    instead of a pixel image on a network (class 'linim').
    [Spotted by Marc Schneble.]
    Fixed.

    o bw.voronoi
    Printed output stated that the cross-validation criterion was minimised
    instead of maximised.

        CHANGES IN spatstat.linnet VERSION 1.65-0

OVERVIEW

    o Package initialised at version 1.65-0

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o spatstat.linnet
    The package 'spatstat.linnet' has been created from a subset
    of the code in the original 'spatstat' package version 1.65-0.
    It contains the functionality for statistical analysis of
    spatial data on a linear network.
    For an overview, see help("spatstat.linnet-package")

    o Execution
    The 'spatstat.linnet' package is slightly faster than the corresponding
    code in the 'spatstat' package, because the procedure for calling
    internal C functions has been streamlined.
