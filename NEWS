        CHANGES IN spatstat.linnet VERSION 2.3-2.025

OVERVIEW

    o We thank Mehdi Moradi and Gopalan Nair for contributions.
    
    o spatstat.linnet now depends on the new packages 'spatstat.explore'
    and 'spatstat.model' rather than the old 'spatstat.core'.
    
    o K function and pair correlation function based on Euclidean distance.

    o Inhomogeneous J function on a network.

    o Terminal vertices of a network.
    
    o Points along a network can be drawn as cross-ticks.

    o Minor improvements and bug fixes.

    o Improvements to internal code.

    o Minor internal changes to package information.

NEW FUNCTIONS

    o linearKEuclid, linearpcfEuclid, linearKEuclidInhom, linearpcfEuclidInhom
    K function and pair correlation function based on Euclidean distances.

    o linearJinhom
    Inhomogeneous J function on a linear network.

    o terminalvertices
    Extract the terminal vertices of a linear network.

    o bw.relrisk.lpp
    This function replaces 'bw.relrisklpp'
    and is a method for the generic 'bw.relrisk'.
    
SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Package dependence
    'spatstat.linnet' now depends on the new packages 'spatstat.explore'
    and 'spatstat.model' rather than the old 'spatstat.core'.
    
    o plot.lpp
    If 'shape="crossticks"', the points will be drawn as
    short line segments perpendicular to the network.

    o densityQuick.lpp
    If 'sigma' is a function for selecting a bandwidth,
    additional arguments '...' of densityQuick.lpp will be passed to 'sigma',
    provided they match the name of a formal argument of 'sigma'.

    o bw.relrisklpp
    This function is now deprecated, and is replaced by 'bw.relrisk.lpp',
    a method for the generic 'bw.relrisk'.

    o bw.relrisk.lpp
    When 'method="likelihood"', the cross-validation criterion
    is now defined as the *negative* likelihood. This is consistent with
    'bw.relrisk', and ensures that the optimum bandwidth is always
    found by minimising the cross-validation criterion.

BUG FIXES

    o rhohat.lpp, rhohat.lppm
    The argument 'subset' was not handled correctly in the internal data.
    The estimated function 'rho' was correct
    but the results of 'predict.rhohat' may have been incorrect
    and were computed only on the 'subset'.
    Fixed.

        CHANGES IN spatstat.linnet VERSION 2.3-2

OVERVIEW

    o 'spatstat.linnet' now depends on 'spatstat.random'.

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o package dependence
    'spatstat.linnet' now depends on the new package 'spatstat.random'.

        CHANGES IN spatstat.linnet VERSION 2.3-1

OVERVIEW

    o More control over resolution of 'linim' objects.
    
    o Improved documentation.

    o Minor improvements and bug fixes.
    
SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o as.linim.default, as.linim.linfun
    New argument 'nd'

    o integral.linfun
    New argument 'nd'

    o rjitterlpp, rjitter.lpp
    The function 'rjitterlpp' has been renamed 'rjitter.lpp'
    and is now a method for the generic 'rjitter'.

    o rjitterlpp
    This function still exists, but is now deprecated in favour of 'rjitter.lpp'.

BUG FIXES

    o rjitterlpp
    The argument 'radius' was interpreted as a fraction of segment length
    rather than an absolute distance.
    Fixed.

    [Contributed by Suman Rakshit.]

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o response.lppm
    Method for 'response' for fitted point process models on a network.

BUG FIXES

    o Math.linim
    If 'Z' was a pixel image on a network (class 'linim')
    and 'v' was a single number, then 'Z/v' was a pixel image (class 'im')
    instead of a pixel image on a network (class 'linim').
    [Spotted by Marc Schneble.]
    Fixed.

    o bw.voronoi
    Printed output stated that the cross-validation criterion was minimised
    instead of maximised.

        CHANGES IN spatstat.linnet VERSION 1.65-0

OVERVIEW

    o Package initialised at version 1.65-0

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o spatstat.linnet
    The package 'spatstat.linnet' has been created from a subset
    of the code in the original 'spatstat' package version 1.65-0.
    It contains the functionality for statistical analysis of
    spatial data on a linear network.
    For an overview, see help("spatstat.linnet-package")

    o Execution
    The 'spatstat.linnet' package is slightly faster than the corresponding
    code in the 'spatstat' package, because the procedure for calling
    internal C functions has been streamlined.
