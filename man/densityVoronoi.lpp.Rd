\details{
  This function is an alternative to \code{\link{density.lpp}}. It
  computes an estimate of the intensity function of a point pattern
  dataset on a linear network.
  The result is a pixel image on the network, giving the estimated intensity.

  This function is a method for the generic \code{\link{densityVoronoi}}
  for the class \code{"lpp"} of point patterns on a linear network.
  
  If \code{f=1} (the default), the Voronoi estimate (Barr and Schoenberg, 2010)
  is computed: the point pattern \code{X} is used to construct
  a Voronoi/Dirichlet tessellation on the network
  (see \code{\link{lineardirichlet}});
  the lengths of the Dirichlet tiles are computed; the estimated intensity
  in each tile is the reciprocal of the tile length.
  The result is a pixel image
  of intensity estimates which are constant on each tile of the tessellation.

  If \code{f=0}, the intensity estimate at every location is
  equal to the average intensity (number of points divided by
  network length). The result is a pixel image
  of intensity estimates which are constant.
  
  If \code{f} is strictly between 0 and 1,
  the smoothed Voronoi estimate (Moradi et al, 2019) is computed.
  The dataset \code{X} is randomly
  thinned by deleting or retaining each point independently, with
  probability \code{f} of retaining a point.
  The thinned pattern
  is used to construct a Dirichlet tessellation and form the
  Voronoi estimate, which is then
  adjusted by a factor \code{1/f}.
  This procedure is repeated \code{nrep} times and the results are
  averaged to obtain the smoothed Voronoi estimate.

  The value \code{f} can be chosen automatically by bandwidth
  selection using \code{\link{bw.voronoi}}.
