\arguments{
  \item{x}{
    A point pattern on a linear network (object of class \code{"lpp"}).

  \item{i}{
   Subset index. A valid subset index in the usual \R sense,

    Spatial window
   (object of class \code{"owin"}) delineating the region that should
   be retained.

    Logical value indicating whether to remove unused levels
    of the marks, if the marks are a factor.
  }
  \item{snip}{
    Logical. If \code{TRUE} (the default), segments of the network
    which cross the boundary of the window \code{j} will be cut by the boundary.
    If \code{FALSE}, these segments will be deleted.

\details{
  This function extracts a designated subset of a point pattern
  on a linear network.

  The function \code{[.lpp} is a method for \code{\link{[}} for the
  class \code{"lpp"}. It extracts a designated subset of a point pattern.
  The argument \code{i} should be a subset index in the usual \R sense:
  either a numeric vector
  of positive indices (identifying the points to be retained),
  a numeric vector of negative indices (identifying the points
  to be deleted) or a logical vector of length equal to the number of
  points in the point pattern \code{x}. In the latter case, 
  the points \code{(x$x[i], x$y[i])} for which 
  \code{subset[i]=TRUE} will be retained, and the others
  will be deleted.

  The argument \code{j}, if present, should be a spatial window.
  The pattern inside the region will be retained.
  \emph{Line segments that cross the boundary of the window
  are deleted} in the current implementation.

  The argument \code{drop} determines whether to remove
  unused levels of a factor, if the point pattern is multitype
  (i.e. the marks are a factor) or if the marks are a data frame or hyperframe
  in which some of the columns are factors.

  The argument \code{snip} specifies what to do with segments of
  the network which cross the boundary of the window \code{j}. 
  If \code{snip=FALSE}, such segments are simply deleted.  
  If \code{snip=TRUE} (the default), such segments are cut into pieces by the
  boundary of \code{j}, and those pieces which lie inside the window
  \code{ji} are included in the resulting network. 

  Use \code{\link{unmark}} to remove all the marks in a marked point
  pattern, and \code{\link{subset.lpp}} to remove only some columns of marks.
