  Area Under ROC Curve for Data on a Network
}
\description{
  Compute the AUC (area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic
  curve) for a fitted point process model on a linear network.
}
\usage{
\method{auc}{lpp}(X, covariate, \dots, high = TRUE)

\method{auc}{lppm}(X, \dots)
}
\arguments{
  \item{X}{
    Point pattern (object of class \code{"ppp"} or \code{"lpp"})
    or fitted point process model (object of class \code{"ppm"}
    or \code{"kppm"} or \code{"lppm"}).
  }
  \item{covariate}{
    Spatial covariate. Either a \code{function(x,y)},
    a pixel image (object of class \code{"im"} or \code{"linim"}), or
    one of the strings \code{"x"} or \code{"y"} indicating the
    Cartesian coordinates.    
  }
  \item{\dots}{
    Arguments passed to \code{\link{as.mask}} controlling the
    pixel resolution for calculations.
  }
  \item{high}{
    Logical value indicating whether the threshold operation
    should favour high or low values of the covariate.
  }
}
\details{
  This command computes the AUC, the area under the Receiver Operating
  Characteristic curve. The ROC itself is computed by \code{\link{roc}}.

  The function \code{\link[spatstat.explore]{auc}} is generic,
  with methods for \code{"ppp"} and \code{"ppm"} described in the help file
  for \code{\link[spatstat.explore]{auc}}.

  This help file describes the methods for classes \code{"lpp"} and
  \code{"lppm"}.
  
  For a point pattern \code{X} and a covariate \code{Z}, the
  AUC is a numerical index that measures the ability of the 
  covariate to separate the spatial domain
  into areas of high and low density of points.
  Let \eqn{x_i}{x[i]} be a randomly-chosen data point from \code{X}
  and \eqn{U} a randomly-selected location in the study region.
  The AUC is the probability that
  \eqn{Z(x_i) > Z(U)}{Z(x[i]) > Z(U)}
  assuming \code{high=TRUE}.
  That is, AUC is the probability that a randomly-selected data point
  has a higher value of the covariate \code{Z} than does a
  randomly-selected spatial location. The AUC is a number between 0 and 1. 
  A value of 0.5 indicates a complete lack of discriminatory power.
  
  For a fitted point process model \code{X},
  the AUC measures the ability of the
  fitted model intensity to separate the spatial domain
  into areas of high and low density of points.
  Suppose \eqn{\lambda(u)}{\lambda(u)} is the intensity function of the model.
  The AUC is the probability that
  \eqn{\lambda(x_i) > \lambda(U)}{\lambda(x[i]) > \lambda(U)}.
  That is, AUC is the probability that a randomly-selected data point
  has higher predicted intensity than does a randomly-selected spatial
  location.
  The AUC is \bold{not} a measure of the goodness-of-fit of the model
  (Lobo et al, 2007).

\value{
  Numeric.
  For \code{auc.lpp}, the result is a single number
  giving the AUC value.
  For \code{auc.lppm}, the result is a 
  numeric vector of length 2 giving the AUC value 
  and the theoretically expected AUC value for this model.
